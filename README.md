Problem Space: Commodity exchange website for the SJSU students
Existing Solutions: Existing commodity exchange websites are craigslist and Madison Stuff exchange
Improvement:  1. System will implement AI based recommendation system to provide most relevant buying or selling options to the student
		          2. In contrast to existing platforms our website will provide buyer a convenience of comparing the posted price on the                        website with the price of the similar commodity on 	the internet.   	
Future Enhancements: 1. Our trading platform could be made more secure by implementing AI technology capable of detecting any in                                  appropriate ads and remove them as well as block the user for posting again.
